                            filters. The recommender is developed by training it dataset of name, artist, and lyrics
                            for 57650 songs in English obtained from Kaggle. The data has been acquired from
                            LyricsFreak through scraping by the author. It will recommend the song based on the
                            similarity between the lyrics of the songs. The whole project is built using Python on
